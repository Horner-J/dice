# Dice Roll

## Project Description
Attempting to create a JavaScript function to simulate a roll of a 6 sided die. This is a basic project to practice creating front end applications
using HTML CSS and JavaScript combined. Essentially a __very__ basic random number generator that returns whole intergers with a user defined maximum 
amount of probablity.

## Future Project Goals:

* User input choice of "dice"
* ~~Basic dice icons instead of text~~ done
* Basic animations
* Multi-user functionality
* Yahtzee-like game with score keeping
